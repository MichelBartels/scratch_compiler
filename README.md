This is an LLVM-based Scratch Compiler that can create command line programs. It supports all necessary instructions to run [this turing machine](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/969636067).

There is currently no GUI support. I/O is only possible using say and ask instructions. Only one entry point is supported.

You can run the compiler using ./compile.sh <Your Scratch project>.
